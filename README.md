# WIS2 topic hierarchy

## Overview

The WIS2 topic hierarchy provides a central classification and categorization scheme used by data
providers and WIS2 Global Services in support of core WIS2 workflows: publish, discover, subscribe
and download.

## Real-time data sharing

WIS 2.0 real-time data sharing is based on a message queuing protocol (MQP) supporting a publication/subscription mechanism. A user can subscribe to an MQP broker to receive real-time notifications that some data can be downloaded. The notification message received from the MQP broker contains a URL to download the data. In addition, the MQP broker offers a range of topics organised in a hierarchy. The users can select their topics of interest and subscribe to them to receive notifications and download data relevant to their work.

## Data discovery
Users can discover datasets from the Global Discovery Catalogue (GDC). Once a user has identified a dataset of interest, they may subscribe to data notifications and updates using the topic and MQP broker found from the GDC dataset discovery metadata. Datasets in the GDC are made available via the WMO Core Metadata Profile 2.0 (WCMP2) standard for discovery metadata, which supports a categorisation scheme consistent with the topic hierarchy to provide a seamless search experience compatible with the access modality provided by the MQP broker. In other words, the MQP topic and WIS 2.0 discovery metadata have the same vocabulary so that discovery, subscription, and download are consistent.

## Structure

The structure of the topic hierarchy underpins the discovery and sharing of data in WIS 2.0, and it has to be standardized across all the WIS 2.0 services to provide consistent search and access to the user.

Recalling that WIS 2.0 is designed to support the WMO Unified Data Policy, the topic hierarchy must be aligned with [WMO Res. 1 Cg-EXT-21 - Unified Data Policy](https://ane4bf-datap1.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wmocms/s3fs-public/ckeditor/files/Cg-Ext2021-d04-1-WMO-UNIFIED-POLICY-FOR-THE-INTERNATIONAL-approved_en_0.pdf?4pv38FtU6R4fDNtwqOxjBCndLIfntWeR).

The WIS 2.0 topic hierarchy has been developed according to the classification of the Earth System domains in Annex 1 of Resolution 1 Cg-Ext(2021), and it is managed in two parts:

1. Primary topic levels (levels 1-8): topic structure applies to all data and services in WIS 2.0 and is managed by the WMO Secretariat
2. Domain-specific topic subcategory levels (level 9 and beyond): topic structure proposed by domain experts and user communities. Note that the number of levels in this part may vary according to the requirements of various domains.

The primary topic levels are described in the following table:

| **Level** | **Name** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | channel | Location of where the data originates from (data providers [`origin`] or global services [`cache`]) |
| **2** | version | Alphabetical version of the topic hierarchy |
| **3** | wis2 | Fixed value of `wis2` for WIS 2.0 |
| **4** | country | Lower case representation of ISO3166 3-letter code. Includes extensions for partner organizations |
| **5** | center-id | Acronym as specified by member and endorsed by the PR of the country and by WMO |
| **6** | resource-type | WIS 2.0 resources types (`data`, `metadata`, `reports` [from monitoring activities]) |
| **7** | data-policy | Data policy as defined by the WMO Unified Data Policy. `core` data are available from the Global Caches with open access on a free and unrestricted basis. Notifications for `core` and `recommended` data are available by subscription to Global Brokers. `recommended` data are downloaded from the original NC/DCPC and may require authentication/authorisation |
| **8** | earth-system-discipline | As per Annex 1 of resolution 1 Cg-Ext-2021 |
| **9** | earth-system-discipline-subcategory | As proposed by domain experts and further approved by INFCOM|
