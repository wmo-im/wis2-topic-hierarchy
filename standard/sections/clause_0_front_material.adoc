[big]*i.     Abstract*

WIS2 real-time data sharing is based on a message queuing protocol (MQP) supporting a
publication/subscription (PubSub) mechanism.  A user can subscribe to an MQP broker to receive
real-time notifications of the existence of new data.

WIS2 brokers offer a range of topics organised in a hierarchy. Users can select their topics of interest and
subscribe to them to receive notifications and download data relevant to their work.

The standard notification message format ensures that the WIS2 ecosystem (data publisher, data
user, and global services) is a robust, effective, and unified exchange platform for weather,
climate, and water data.

This document defines the structure of the WIS Topic Hierarchy.  Topics are utilized by WIS Nodes, Global
Broker services, and data/metadata subscribers.

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

wmo, wis 2.0, weather, climate, water, topic hierarchy, metadata, pubsub, mqp, message queuing protocol

[big]*iii.    Security Considerations*

Based on the WMO Unified Data Policy for the International Exchange of Earth System Data (Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021) footnote:[https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=11113#page=9], exchanged data are classified as `+core+` or `+recommended+`.  Core data is considered fully open and unrestricted with no security considerations.  Recommended data may have access control defined.

No security considerations have been made for this standard.
