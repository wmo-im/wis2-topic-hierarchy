atmospheric-composition,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, the observing component of the Global Atmosphere Watch Programme and other information on the chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the atmosphere that are produced in all parts of the globe. These data support multiple applications and are needed in order to reduce environmental risks to society, meet the requirements of environmental conventions, strengthen capabilities to predict climate, weather and air quality, and contribute to scientific assessments in support of environmental policy."
climate,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, current and historic time series data needed to understand climate change, assess the associated impacts and risks for lives, livelihoods, and property and support climate services. Data shall be made available in a timely manner, with a tentative maximum delay of one year."
cryosphere,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, monitoring data on snow, freshwater and sea ice, glaciers and ice caps, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, ice sheets, ice shelves and icebergs that are necessary for specified applications."
hydrology,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, near/real time data, historical time series and aggregated data, that are fundamental to global knowledge of the hydrological cycle and essential to the application of such knowledge to support and protect life and health; ensure economic prosperity and well-being; and effectively manage resources through the undertaking of operational hydrology."
ocean,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, in situ and remotely sensed observational data both in and above the ocean and at the sea surface, from the open ocean to the coast, along with other data that provide necessary input to ocean monitoring and prediction and for a variety of other Earth system applications."
space-weather,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, global and regional space weather services, requiring near-real time exchange of space weather surface-based and space-based observations, are operated on bilateral and multilateral data exchange agreements between centres."
weather,"High-level earth system discipline as identified in Annex 1 of the Unified Data Policy, including, but not limited to, observational and other data necessary to support weather monitoring and prediction efforts of the WMO Members. Such data are generally exchanged in real or near-real time, depending on the specific application."
