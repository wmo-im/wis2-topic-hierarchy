== WIS2 Topic Hierarchy
Note: This section of this working draft document is the same as Appendix F in the https://library.wmo.int/idurl/4/68731[_Manual on the WMO Information System_] (WMO-No. 1060), Volume II as approved by EC-78.

The WIS2 Topic Hierarchy (WTH) provides a mechanism for users to subscribe to and receive data or metadata notifications. It is documented in discovery metadata records and leveraged by WIS2 brokers.

The normative provisions in the WTH are denoted by the base Uniform Resoure Identifier (URI) ``http://wis.wmo.int/spec/wth/1`` and requirements are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to this base. Topics, values, and examples are represented with ``shaded text``.

=== 1. Requirements Class Core

==== 1.1 Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

The WTH is composed of primary topics (levels 1-7) and sub-discipline specific topics (levels 8 and beyond).

The primary topics apply to all data and resources in WIS.  They are relational, meaning that any combination of the values in each level can be used to construct a topic applicable to a notification.

The sub-discipline topics are proposed by domain experts and user communities.  These levels are a hierarchical representation of the datase, and the number of levels in this part may vary according to the requirements of various domains.

The representation is encoded as a simple text string of values in each topic level, separated by a slash (``/``). 

_Examples_:

``origin/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop``

``cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/prediction/forecast/medium-range/probabilistic/global``

``origin/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop``

``origin/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/recommended/atmospheric-composition/experimental/space-based-observation/geostationary/solar-flares``

Table 1 provides an overview of the primary topic levels.

|===
|Level|Name|Description

|1
|channel
|Location at which the data originates (data providers are ``origin`` and Global Services are ``cache``)

|2
|version
|Alphabetical version of the topic hierarchy, currently: ``a`` 

|3
|system
|Fixed value of ``wis2`` for WIS2

|4
|centre-id
|Acronym proposed by Member and endorsed by WMO Secretariat

|5
|notification-type
|WIS2 notification types (``data`` or ``metadata``)

|6
|data-policy
|Data policy as defined by the WMO Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)))footnote:[Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)) â€“ WMO Unified Policy for the International Exchange of Earth System Data (World Meteorological Congress: Abridged Final Report of the Extraordinary Session (WMO-No. 1281))] (``core`` or ``recommended``)

|7
|earth-system-discipline
|Seven high-level categories as defined by the WMO Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021))) - Annex 1 (``atmospheric-composition``, ``climate``, ``cryosphere``, ``hydrology``, ``ocean``, ``space-weather`` or ``weather``)

==== 1.2 Publishing

For maximum utility and efficient management of topics, it is recommended that ``data`` is published to a detailed level of the topic hierarchy. This helps  avoid the "pollution" of data messages under the primary topics.  

Note: Each discipline has a sub-discipline topic named ``experimental`` for publication to provisional topics.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_publishing.adoc[]
include::../recommendations/core/PER_publishing.adoc[]

==== 1.3 Management
The primary levels and sub-discipline specific levels are managed differently to maintain stability and allow for flexibility.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_management.adoc[]
include::../requirements/core/REQ_releasing.adoc[]

==== 1.4 Versioning

The topic hierarchy version helps data providers and data consumers with change management and transition in relation to updates.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_versioning.adoc[]

==== 1.5 Conventions

All levels of the topic hierarchy are defined in a consistent manner to support a normalized and predictable structure.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conventions.adoc[]

==== 1.6 Centre identification
//specified by WIS Centre or Member?
The centre identifier (``centre-id``) is an acronym, as proposed by the Member and endorsed by the WMO Secretariat.  It is a single identifier comprised of a top-level domain (TLD) and centre name. It represents the data publisher, distributor or issuing centre of a given dataset, data product, data granule or other resource.
